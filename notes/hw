Open questions about the hardware
===================================

- Does coarse rasterisation do us any good? It runs at 4x4 pixels per cycle, same as fine rasterisation.
- Should depth test run on 4x2 blocks instead? Would simplify the cache a lot.
- Since we seem to be fill rate limited, should we reduce the front parts to 2x2 blocks instead of 4x4?
- How to do performance measurements...
- Should there be multiple fragment pipelines?
- There are too many multipliers in the UV interpolation.
